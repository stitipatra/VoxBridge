# अनुवादिनी

> **Offline Multilingual Translation for Text, Audio, and Video with AI-generated Speech & Subtitles**

अनुवादिनी is an end-to-end offline AI-powered translation system that translates **text, audio, and video** into multiple languages while preserving accessibility through **speech synthesis** and **subtitle generation**. All processing is performed locally without requiring cloud services or API keys.

# Design Decisions

अनुवादिनी prioritizes **translation quality**, **offline execution**, and **subtitle consistency** over aggressive parallel processing.

### Full-Context Translation

Instead of translating each Whisper segment independently, अनुवादिनी first generates a complete transcript and translates it as a single document.

This approach:

- Produces more natural translations.
- Preserves sentence-level context.
- Ensures the translated text shown in the UI exactly matches the embedded subtitles.
- Simplifies debugging and deterministic processing.

### Audio Synchronization

Languages differ in speaking speed and sentence structure.

To preserve speech quality:

- Small duration differences are automatically corrected.
- Large differences are adjusted only within a safe playback-speed boundary.
- Excessive slow-motion speech is intentionally avoided.
- Video duration is always preserved and subtitles continue throughout the entire video.

### Offline First

The complete pipeline runs locally using Faster-Whisper, NLLB-200, eSpeak NG and FFmpeg.

No cloud APIs, internet connection, or API keys are required after setup.

# Installation

Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/अनुवादिनी.git

cd अनुवादिनी
```

Create a virtual environment

### Windows

```bash
python -m venv venv

venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

# Running अनुवादिनी

Launch the application

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The Streamlit interface will open automatically in your browser.

---

# Architecture

Although the project is structured using **FastAPI** modules, the Streamlit frontend directly invokes the backend processing functions. This keeps deployment simple while maintaining a clean and modular architecture.

The processing pipeline is:

```text
Streamlit UI
      │
      ▼
process_file()
      │
      ▼
Transcription Service
      │
      ▼
Translation Service
      │
      ▼
TTS Service
      │
      ▼
Video Service
      │
      ▼
Output Files
```

The FastAPI application is retained to support future REST API integration without changing the processing logic.

# Scalability

Although the current implementation processes media using a single translation pipeline, the architecture has been intentionally designed to support future scaling.

Potential enhancements include:

- Chunk-based transcription for long videos
- Parallel Whisper inference
- Queue-based worker processing
- GPU-backed batch inference
- Segment-level TTS alignment
- Distributed media storage
- REST API deployment using FastAPI
- Real-time progress tracking

---

# Supported Inputs

### Text

- `.txt`

### Audio

- `.mp3`
- `.wav`
- `.m4a`
- `.aac`
- `.flac`

### Video

- `.mp4`
- `.mov`
- `.mkv`
- `.avi`

| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Incorrect Hindi subtitle rendering   | Migrated from SRT to ASS subtitles with bundled Noto Sans Devanagari font     |
| Subtitle overflow on portrait videos | Dynamic font sizing, margins and language-specific wrapping                   |
| Translation inconsistencies          | Adopted full-context translation instead of segment-wise translation          |
| Audio/video duration mismatch        | Implemented bounded playback-speed adjustment while preserving speech quality |
| Cross-platform deployment            | Bundled FFmpeg, fonts and eSpeak dependencies                                 |
| Large file uploads                   | Increased Streamlit upload limit to support media files up to 2 GB            |
